# MZHyper
This is a collection of MATLAB codes to reproduce all the figures and tables in our paper "On the quadrature exactness in hyperinterpolation", which is available on [arxiv 2202.13691](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13691).

# Interval
Please add [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/), the [Chebfun](https://www.chebfun.org/) Toolbox "chebfun-master" [2], and the code files by S. Foucart for reproducing figures in [1] onto path before running the codes.

[1] COMPUTING A QUANTITY OF INTEREST FROM OBSERVATIONAL DATA
by R. DeVore, S. Foucart, G. Petrova, P. Wojtaszczyk. 
Codes available at https://www.math.tamu.edu/~foucart/papers.html.
The zip file (reproducible+supplement) also contains CVX

# Sphere
Please add the sphere_approx_toolbox_v3.0 (can be found in this repository) onto path before running the codes.
